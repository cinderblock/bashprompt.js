v0.2.1:
    date: 2014-02-23
    changes:
        - Added support for execSync on partials so it allows synchronous
          partial evaluation.
        - Decoupled styles from context builder to render layer via template
          rendering.
        - Switched to a template context based system instead of the previous
          plain builder.
        - Switched to a template string engine instead of the previous
          renderer.
        - Added support for expressions on template engine strings to allow
          styles ( foreground and background colors ) on templates.
        - Added git branch-name partial feature ( synchronous version ).

v0.2.0:
    date: 2014-02-21
    changes:
        - First usable version of bashprompt.js.
        - Almost everything is hard coded so it needs a general refactor and
          a lot of unit testing. Be patient! This is a work in progress.
